	After graduation, I would like to get a job in consumer research.  Last summer, my internship was in the research department of Showtime Networks, so finding a position in the entertainment industry again would be <em>ideal</em>.  I would also like to move to New York City.  Living there for a few years after graduation would be <b>a lot</b> of fun and a great adventure!

		<h2>Prince William and Kate Hire His Former Nanny to Care for Prince George</h2>
		<p>by Simon Perry, <time datetime="9-11-2013" pubdate>September 11, 2013</time></p>
	</header>
	<p>Prince William and Kate Middleton decided to hire William's childhood nanny to help look after their newborn son, Prince George.  The nanny, Jessie Webb, is 71 and has worked with royalty for decades, so she is a good and trustworthy choice for the job.  Webb was quite close to both William and Harry and served as a confidant to them, especially when their parents were having marital problems.  Here is an excerpt from the original article:</p>
	<p><i>"East-London born Webb, who has no children of her own, was hired by Princess Diana and Prince Charles to look after both Prince Harry and William and was often a comfort to the young princes during their parents' marriage troubles.  She attended William's 21st birthday party and was a guest at the royal wedding two years ago."</i></p>
