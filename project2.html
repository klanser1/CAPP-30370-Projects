	After graduation, I would like to get a job in consumer research.  Last summer, my internship was in the research department of Showtime Networks, so finding a position in the entertainment industry again would be <em>ideal</em>.  I would also like to move to New York City.  Living there for a few years after graduation would be <b>a lot</b> of fun and a great adventure!
