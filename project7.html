				<p>The movie focuses on an old man reading a story to an old woman in 
		a nursing home. The story he reads follows two young lovers named 
		Allie Hamilton and Noah Calhoun, who meet one evening at a carnival. 
		But they are separated by Allie's parents who disapprove of Noah's 
		poor family, and move Allie away. After waiting for Noah to 
		write her for several years, Allie meets and gets engaged to a 
		handsome young soldier named Lon. Allie, then, with her love for Noah 
		still alive, stops by Noah's 200-year-old home that he restored for 
		her, "to see if he's okay". It is evident that they still have 
		feelings for each other, and Allie has to choose between her fianc&eacute; 
		and her first love.</p>

				<p>Ryan Gosling was born on November 12, 1980, in London, Ontario, to 
		Thomas and Donna Gosling, and was the second of their two children. 
		The Gosling family, moved to Cornwall, Ontario, where Ryan grew up 
		and was home-schooled by his mother. Ryan attended Cornwall Collegiate 
		and Vocational High School in Cornwall, where he excelled in Drama 
		and Fine Arts. The family then relocated to Burlington, Ontario, 
		where Ryan attended Lester B. Pearson High School in Burlington, 
		Ontario.</p>
				<p>Ryan first performed as a singer at talent contests with his older 
		sister Mandi. He attended an open audition in Montreal for the TV 
		series "The Mickey Mouse Club" ("The All New Mickey Mouse Club" 
		(1989)) in January 1993 and beat out 17,000 other aspiring actors for 
		a spot on the show. While appearing on "MMC" for two years, he lived 
		with co-star Justin Timberlake's family.</p>
				<p>Though he received no formal acting training, after "MMC," Gosling 
		segued into an acting career, appearing on the TV series "Young 
		Hercules" (1998) and "Breaker High" (1997), as well as the films 
		The Slaughter Rule (2002), Murder by Numbers (2002), and Remember 
		the Titans (2000). He first attracted serious critical attention with 
		his performance as the Jewish neo-Nazi in the controversial film The 
		Believer (2001), which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2001 Sundance 
		Film Festival. He was cast in the part by writer-director Henry Bean,
		 who believed that Gosling's strict upbringing gave him the insight 
		 to understand the character Danny, whose obsessiveness with the 
		 Judaism he was born into turns to hatred. He was nominated for an 
		 Independent Spirit Award as Best Male Lead in 2002 for the role and 
		 won the Golden Aries award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics.</p>
				<p>After appearing in the sleeper The Notebook (2004) in 2004, Gosling
		 won the dubious honor of being named one of the 50 Hottest Bachelors 
		 by People Magazine. More significantly, he was named the Male Star 
		 of Tomorrow at the 2004 Show West convention of movie exhibitors.</p>
				<p>Gosling reached the summit of his profession with his performance 
		in Half Nelson (2006), which garnered him an Academy Award nomination 
		as Best Actor. In a short time, he has established himself as one of 
		the finest actors of his generation.</p>
